This Angular application uses the Angular MSAL v2 library to authenticate a user and then makes a request to the Graph API as the authenticated user. The response to the request is displayed in the web browser.

## Prerequisites

- A Microsoft Entra tenant and the permissions or role required for managing app registrations in the tenant.
- Node.js 16+
- Angular 12

## Setup

### 1. Register the app

First, complete the steps in [Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app) to register the application.

Use these settings in your app registration.

| App registration <br/> setting    | Value for this sample app                                                    | Notes                                                                                              |
|---------------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Name**                          | `Angular SPA`                                                                | Suggested value for this sample. <br/> You can change the app name at any time.                    |
| **Supported account types**       | **Accounts in this organizational directory only (Single tenant)**           | Suggested value for this sample.                                                                   |
| **Platform type**                 | Single-Page Application                                                      | Required value for this sample.                                                 |
| **Redirect URI**                  | `http://localhost:4200`                                                      | Required value for this sample.                                                                    |

> :information_source: **Bold text** in the tables above matches (or is similar to) a UI element in the Microsoft Entra admin center, while `code formatting` indicates a value you enter into a text box in the Microsoft Entra admin center.

### 2. Update code sample in _app.module.ts_ with app registration values

```javascript
// 'Application (client) ID' of app registration in the Microsoft Entra admin center - this value is a GUID
clientId: 'Enter_the_Application_Id_Here',
    
// Full directory URL, in the form of https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant>
authority: 'https://login.microsoftonline.com/Enter_the_Tenant_ID_Here',

// Must be the same redirectUri as what was provided in your Microsoft Entra app registration.
redirectUri: 'Enter_the_Redirect_URI_Here'
```

### 3. Install package(s)

To install required packages:

```console
npm install
```

## Run the application

```console
ng serve --open
```

Follow the instructions that are presented on the web browser. If everything worked, you should receive a response similar to this on the "View Profile" page:

## About the code

This Angular web application uses the Angular MSAL v2 library to authenticate a user and then makes a request to the Microsoft Graph API as the authenticated user to retrieve their user profile data.
- MSALGuard is used to protect the web app's routes.
- MSALBroadcastService is used to consume events emitted by MSAL.  Events such as "login success" and "acquire token success" tell the app when the user has sucessfully been authenticated.
- MSALInterceptor is an Interceptor clsss provided by MSAL Angular to automatically and silently acquire access tokens for known resources, in this case for Graph.
- HttpClient is used to issue an HTTP GET request to Microsoft Graph with user's access token.
